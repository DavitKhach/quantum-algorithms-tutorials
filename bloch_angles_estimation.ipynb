    "Now let's introduce one more interesting procidure that will help us to double check the main procidure. In the first example we chosed Bloch angles randomly and estimated them with the `estimate_bloch_angles` function. At the end we had estimated Bloch angles and true angles and it was easy to test the estimation procidure just by comparing them. What if we don't know the true Bloch angles and the comparition cannot be made. In this cas we can implement the [SWAP test][3] method to determine the absolute value of the inner product between the input quantum state $\\left|\\psi_{in} \\right\\rangle$ and created quantum state with the estimated Bloch angles $\\left|\\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle$. In other words, the output of the SWAP test is equal to $\\left|\\left\\langle \\psi_{in} \\right|\\left| \\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle \\right|^2$, that is equal to $1$ if the quantum states are the same (or different only by a global phase factor $\\left| \\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle = e^{i\\phi}\\left|\\psi_{in} \\right\\rangle$). So, after runing the SWAP test and checking if $\\left|\\left\\langle \\psi_{in} \\right|\\left| \\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle \\right|^2 \\approx 1$, then we have currect estimation procidure.\n",
