    "In Quantum Computing one of the most important and basic idea is the concept of the one qubit quantum state. In general one qubit state can be described with two complex numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "|\\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers. Although $2$ complex numbers can be described with $4$ real numbers, we will show that we need only two numbers in order to describe one qubit state. $|\\alpha|^2$ and $|\\beta|^2$ are probabilities of measuring the qubit in respectively $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states. The sum of the probabilities should be equal to unity (normalization):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we have the global phase ambiguity. The idea of the the global phase ambiguity is in the imposibility to distinguish between two states that differ from each other only by $e^{i \\varphi_g}$ global phase:\n",

    "|\\psi_2 \\rangle = e^{i \\varphi_g} \\left( \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words there is no measurement procidure that will let us to find $e^{i \\varphi_g}$. All quantum states that differ from each other only by different global phase are the same quantum state practically (experimentally). That is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "|\\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle = e^{i\\varphi_g}|\\alpha| |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle = e^{i\\varphi_g} \\left( |\\alpha| |0\\rangle + e^{-i\\varphi_g} \\beta  |1\\rangle \\right) \\stackrel{\\text{up to }\\varphi_g}{=} \\alpha' |0\\rangle + \\beta' |1\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha' = |\\alpha|$ is a real positive number and $\\beta' = e^{-i\\varphi_g} \\beta$ is a complex number. So, we are left with one real number and one complex number that describe one qubit state (overall $3$ real numbers). If we will add the normalization $|\\alpha'|^2 + |\\beta'|^2 = 1$ we can reduce the needed real numbers to describe one qubit state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi \\rangle = \\alpha' |0\\rangle + \\beta' |1\\rangle = \\alpha' |0\\rangle + e^{i\\varphi}|\\beta'| |1\\rangle = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) |0\\rangle + e^{i\\varphi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) |1\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi ]$ is chosen such that $\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\alpha'$ and $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = |\\beta'|$, because $\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = 1$. $\\phi \\in [0, 2 \\pi)$ is the phase of the $\\beta'$ complex number. Thus we can describe the one qubit states with only two numbers: with $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. The goal of this tutorial is to estimate $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ (aka Bloch angles) with Qiskit. With this two numbers we can define the Bloch shere [[2]]:\n",

    "Bloch shpere is the geomentrical description of one qubit pure states. Each point on the Bloch sphere represents a distinct quantum state. If we want to obtain some one qubit quantum state with given $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$ we can apply Qiskit's $U(\\theta, \\phi, 0)$ gate to the qubit that is in the $|0\\rangle$ (initial default quantum state for most QCs):\n",

    "Now we know how to prepare any one qubit state, but let's assume that after some quantum circuit we have a single qubit pure state that we want to estimate. In other words we want to know what are the Bloch angles of the qubit. Here we are going discuss one such procidure that finds the Bloch angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this procidure we assume that we can recreate the $|\\psi\\rangle$ one qubit state of interest as many times as needed. This means, that the quantum circuit that outputs $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be reruned. Also, we assume that the qubit is not in the entangled state (it is **one** qubit state) and we don't have quantum errors (one qubit **pure** state). The last two assumption can be easily checked in our procidure, so we will check them.\n",

Note that $\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = P(0)$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in the $|0\\rangle$ state and $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = P(1)$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in the $|1\\rangle$ state.
