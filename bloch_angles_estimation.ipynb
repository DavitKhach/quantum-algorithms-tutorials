    "\n",
    "Sometimes in Quantum Computing one needs to check or test the output of the quantum algorithms. In this tutorial, we are going to show how one can estimate Bloch sphere angles that can be used for example for testing quantum state teleportation protocol or the simplest and smallest implementations of the HHL algorithm. For the same proposes one can use the Swap test, that is also introduced here. Actually, we have introduced the Swap test for testing the Bloch sphere angles estimation procedure. Here we talk mainly about quantum pure states, but at the end, we have added what one can do for a more general case (how to implement the quantum state tomography for a mixed state).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Quantum Computing one of the most important and basic ideas is the concept of the one-qubit quantum state. In general one-qubit state can be described with two complex numbers [[1]]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle = \\alpha \\left|0 \\right\\rangle + \\beta \\left|1 \\right\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers. Although $2$ complex numbers can be described with $4$ real numbers, we will show that we need only two numbers in order to describe one-qubit state. $\\left| \\alpha \\right|^2$ and $\\left| \\beta \\right|^2$ are probabilities of measuring the qubit in respectively $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle$ states. The sum of the probabilities should be equal to unity (normalization):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left| \\alpha \\right|^2 + \\left| \\beta \\right|^2 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we have the global phase ambiguity. The idea of the global phase ambiguity is in the impossibility to distinguish between two states that differ from each other only by $e^{i \\varphi_g}$ global phase [[1]]:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there is no measurement procedure that will let us find $e^{i \\varphi_g}$. So, experimentally/practically $\\left|\\psi_1 \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|\\psi_2 \\right\\rangle$ can be regarded as the same states [[1]]. That is why:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha' = |\\alpha|$ is a real positive number and $\\beta' = e^{-i\\varphi_g} \\beta$ is a complex number. So, we are left with one real number and one complex number that describe one-qubit state (overall $3$ real numbers). If we will add the normalization $|\\alpha'|^2 + |\\beta'|^2 = 1$ we can reduce the needed real numbers to describe one-qubit state:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle &= \\alpha' \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + \\beta' \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle = \\alpha' \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle + e^{i\\varphi}|\\beta'| \\left| 1 \\right\\rangle =\n",

Thus we can describe one-qubit states with just two numbers: $\\theta$ and $\\phi$. The goal of this tutorial is to estimate $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ (aka Bloch sphere angles) with Qiskit. All possible values of the $\\left(\\theta,\\phi \\right)$ pair can be described geometrically with the Bloch sphere [[1]]:\n",

    "Each point on the Bloch sphere represents a distinct quantum (we assume pure) state.

    "Now let's assume that after some quantum circuit we have a quantum state whose Bloch sphere angles ($\\theta$ and $\\varphi$) we want to estimate. In other words, we want to know what are the Bloch angles of the qubit. Here we are going to discuss one such procedure that finds the Bloch angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this procedure, we assume that we can recreate the $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$ one-qubit state of interest as many times as we want. This means, that the quantum circuit that outputs $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$ can be re-executed. Also, we assume that the qubit is not in the entangled state (it is **one** qubit state) and we don't have quantum errors (one-qubit **pure** state). The last two assumptions can be easily checked in our procedure, hence, we will check them with few code lines.\n",
    "\n",

    "For this procedure we need to calculate the expectation values of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ operators. From these three real numbers (expectation values) we can determine the Bloch angles.

Note that $\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = P(0)$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in the $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ state and $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = P(1)$ is the probability of measuring the qubit in the $\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle$ state.

Therefore, half of our work can be completed by estimating the $\\left\\langle Z \\right\\rangle$ or equivalently by estimating the $P(0)$. But how to estimate $P(0)$ experimentally with the quantum computer? For that, we just need to re-execute the circuit $N$ times and count how many times we had measured $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ state ($N_0$). $\\frac{N_0}{N}$ will be our approximation for $P(0)$:\n",

    "Now let's introduce one more interesting procedure that will help us to double-check the main procedure. In the first example, we chose Bloch angles randomly and estimated them with the `estimate_bloch_angles` function. At the end, we had the estimated Bloch angles and the true Bloch angles and it was easy to test the estimation procedure just by comparing them. What if we don't know the true Bloch angles and the comparison cannot be made. In this case, we can implement the [Swap test][3] method to determine the absolute value of the inner product between the input quantum state $\\left|\\psi_{in} \\right\\rangle$ and the created quantum state with the estimated Bloch angles $\\left|\\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle$. In other words, the output of the Swap test is equal to $\\left|\\left\\langle \\psi_{in} \\right|\\left| \\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle \\right|^2$, that is equal to $1$ if the quantum states are the same (or differ only by a global phase factor $\\left| \\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle = e^{i\\phi}\\left|\\psi_{in} \\right\\rangle$). So, after running the Swap test and checking if $\\left|\\left\\langle \\psi_{in} \\right|\\left| \\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle \\right|^2 \\approx 1$, we will know that the Bloch angles estimation procedure works.\n",

The other two qubits are in the given $\\left| \\psi_{1} \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left| \\psi_{2} \\right\\rangle$ (in our case $\\left|\\psi_{in} \\right\\rangle$ and $\\left|\\psi_{est} \\right\\rangle$) quantum states for which we want to calculate $\\left|\\left\\langle \\psi_{1} \\right|\\left| \\psi_{2} \\right\\rangle \\right|^2$.

    "Now let's apply a sequence of random gates to a qubit and measure its Bloch angles. After finding the Bloch angles we will use the same state obtained with the same gate sequence and compare its state with another qubit that is going to be initialized by the estimated Bloch angles. Random gates will not allow us straightforwardly estimate the Bloch angles and hence the Bloch angles are not given to us in this problem as it was previously. We can either multiply the matrices that correspond to the gates to each other and try to estimate mathematically the Bloch angles or we can do it in a \"quantum way\" with the Swap test. If Bloch angles estimation is correct then the output of the Swap test should be $\\approx 1$."

For this case, we can't attribute to the quantum state one $\\left|\\psi \\right\\rangle$, but we can define a density matrix that will give us all needed measurement properties for the quantum state. In this case, when we don't have a pure state we should do the quantum state tomography for estimating the density matrix.
