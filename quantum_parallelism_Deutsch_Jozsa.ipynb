    "One of the main resons that makes quantum computing so differnet from the classical computing is possiblity to have superposition states. This ability gives rise to somthing called quantum parallelism [[1](https://www.cambridge.org/am/academic/subjects/physics/quantum-physics-quantum-information-and-quantum-computation/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-10th-anniversary-edition?format=HB)]. This enables us to compute values/outputs of some function with given different inputs at the same time. Let's say we have two registers one for input the other for output. The initial state is given by $\\left| x \\right\\rangle \\left| y \\right\\rangle$ wavefunction, where $\\left| x \\right\\rangle$ is the register with $x$ input and $\\left| 0 \\right\\rangle$ is the output register where we will store the value of the $f(x)$ function. After applying the circuit that corresponds to the given function the wavefucntion becomes $\\left| x \\right\\rangle \\left| f(x) \\; mod \\; 2 \\right\\rangle$, where we have used [[modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic)]. Here is the circuit:\n",

    "\n",
    "The $U_{f(x)}$ is the unitary operator that acts on both input and output registers and corresponds to our given $f(x)$ fuction. Let's see what is happening when $\\left| x \\right\\rangle$ is some superpositional state of two qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left| x \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left| 00 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 01 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 11 \\right\\rangle \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This superposition state will let us to witness the quantum parallelism in action. Now let's not foeget the output register and write down the combained state of two registers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left| \\psi_{initial} \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| x \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}  \\left[ \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| 00 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| 01 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle + \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\left| 11 \\right\\rangle \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After $U_{f(x)}$ unitary operator the combained state will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left| \\psi_{final} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}  \\left[ \\left| f(00) \\right\\rangle \\left| 00 \\right\\rangle + \\left| f(01) \\right\\rangle \\left| 01 \\right\\rangle + \\left| f(10) \\right\\rangle \\left| 10 \\right\\rangle + \\left| f(11) \\right\\rangle \\left| 11 \\right\\rangle \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are already there. So, we have applyed one $U_{f(x)}$ unitary operator, but, in fact, the $f(x)$ fuction was evaluated 4 times for each term in superposition state. This is waht we call qauntum parallelism, and this quantum computing feature is widely used in lots of quantum algorithms. Let see how it works for some specific function. Suppose we have a function that for those $x$s that have even number of $1$ bit the $f(x) = 0$ and when the number of $1$s is odd the $f(x) = 1$. To make things more interesting we will use $3$ qubits for the input circuit. Here is the circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/qparallel_example.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ indices denote the input qubits and $o$ denotes the output qubit. Here first 3 Hadamard gate are just for preparing a 3 qubit superposition state. The CNOT gates represent our given function $f(x)$ that have an output $0$ if there are even number of $1$s, and $1$ otherwise. Now let's go step by step and see how the quantum state changes. "
