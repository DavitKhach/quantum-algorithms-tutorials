This is a collection of tutorials for quantum algorithms. 
Here is the list of the tutorials (existing and planned).

* [Quantum parallelism and Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/quantum_parallelism_Deutsch_Jozsa.ipynb)

* [Iterative quantum phase estimation algorithm (IQPE or IPEA)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb)

* [Quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPE or PEA)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb)

* [Hamiltonian simulation](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/Hamiltonian_simulation.ipynb)

* [Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/variational_quantum_eigensolver.ipynb)

* *Quantum state tomography* (planed)
* *Adiabatic state preparation* (planed)
* *HHL algorithm* (planed)
* *Simon's algorithm* (planed)
* *Shor's quantum factoring algorithm* (planed)
* ...

There are two recomended ways to use this tutorials:

1) In each Jupyter Notebook tutorial that can be accessed
from the GitHub one can find a link to the *nbviewer* 
(e.g. **[[Open with the nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/variational_quantum_eigensolver.ipynb)]** 
that will open the tutorial in a more readable format than 
it is here in GitHub.
 
2) To download the repository an open the jupyter notebook 
tutorials with a browser locally. For that one will need to
install the following packages:

* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/):  an open-source framework for working with quantum computers.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install): a tool for interactive computing.

P.S. If you will find errors in the codes or in the text (grammar, math) please let me know.
