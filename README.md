This is a collection of tutorials for quantum algorithms. 
Here is the list of the tutorials (existing and planned).

* [Iterative phase estimation algorithm (IPEA)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb)

* [Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/variationa_quantum_eigensolver.ipynb)

* *Phase estimation algorithm (PEA)* (next)
* *HHL algorithm* (planed)
* *Simon's algorithm* (planed)
* *Shor's quantum factoring algorithm* (planed)
* ...

For working with the jupyter notebook tutorials the following packages are required:

* [qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/):  an open-source framework for working with quantum computers.
* [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install): a tool for interactive computing.
