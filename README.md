This is a collection of tutorials for quantum algorithms. 
Here is the list of the tutorials (existing and planned).

* [Estimation of Bloch sphere angles](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/bloch_angles_estimation.ipynb)

* [Quantum parallelism and Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/quantum_parallelism_Deutsch_Jozsa.ipynb)

* [Iterative quantum phase estimation algorithm (IQPE)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb)

* [Quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPE)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/quantum_phase_estimation.ipynb)

* [Hamiltonian simulation](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/Hamiltonian_simulation.ipynb)

* [Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/variational_quantum_eigensolver.ipynb)

* ...

There are two recomended ways to use this tutorials:

1) In each Jupyter Notebook tutorial that can be accessed
from the GitHub one can find a link to the *nbviewer* 
(e.g. **[[Open with the nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/variational_quantum_eigensolver.ipynb)]**) 
that will open the tutorial in a more readable format than 
it is here in the GitHub.
 
2) To download the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook 
tutorials with a browser locally. This also will allow to
run the code from the tutorials. For that one will need to
install the following packages:

* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/):  an open-source framework for working with quantum computers.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install): a tool for interactive computing.

P.S. If you will find errors in the codes or in the text (grammar, math) please let me know.
