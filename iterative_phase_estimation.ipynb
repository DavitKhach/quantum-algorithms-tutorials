    "# Iterative phase estimation algorithm \n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative phase estimation algorithm is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [1]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies of corresponding eigenstates) for some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian. Because $H$ is a Hermitian operator, not unitary, (the algorithm works only with unitary operators) we can't estimate directly its eigenvalues. Instead, we create some unitary operator from $H$ and estimate not the eigenvalues of $H$, but something different (the **phase**). The good news is that from this **phase** (we will talk about it later) one can obtain the corresponding eigenvalue of $H$. So, in the end, we are not only estimating the **phase** but, what is more important, the desired eigenvalue. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create unitary operator $U$ from given $H$: \n",
    "$$U = e^{iHt}.$$ \n",
    "Here $t$ is a parameter that we can change\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Apply $U$ on the eigenstate $| \\psi_k \\rangle$ of $H$. For simplicity, we will assume that the eigenstate is given: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U | \\psi_k \\rangle = e^{iHt} | \\psi_k \\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Taylor series for the exponent we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} | \\psi_k \\rangle = i t H | \\psi_k \\rangle - \\frac{t^2}{2} H^2 | \\psi_k \\rangle + \\frac{t^4}{4} H^4 | \\psi_k \\rangle - ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And by using the Schrödinger equation $H | \\psi_k \\rangle = E_{k} | \\psi_k \\rangle$, we will obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} |\\psi_k \\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} |\\psi_k \\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_k$ is the eigenvalue of the corresponding $| \\psi_k \\rangle$ eigenstate. By the way, the goal of the algorithm is to find $E_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt}|\\psi_k \\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} |\\psi_k \\rangle  = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi} |\\psi_k \\rangle ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi = E_{k}t / 2 \\pi$ is the **phase** that the algorithm is capable to estimate. After estimating the phase it will be easy to estimate the corresponding eigenvalue:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{k} = 2 \\pi \\varphi / t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how the algorithm actually works. Firstly, we should import all the packages that we will use."

After this we apply to the ancillary qubit the Hadamard gate. In this step, the $|+\\rangle_a$ state will transform to the $|0\\rangle_a$ state and the $|-\\rangle_a$ state will transform to the $|0\\rangle_a$ state. So, just by measuring the ancillary qubit one will know is the phase $0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$.

Moreover, we should start estimating the bits starting from the last bit. For example let's find $\\varphi = 0.11$ **phase**. Notice, that after **cantrol_H** we will have following exponent $exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11)$. If we will apply **cantrol_H** twice we will obtain two exponents $exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11) \\cdot exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11) = exp(i 2 \\pi 0.1)$, because $2 \\cdot 0.11 = 2 \\cdot (\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}) = (1 + \\frac{1}{2}) = 1.1$. This way we are coming to the simple example explained above (\\varphi is equal to $0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$). So it will be easy to estimate the second bit from $\\varphi = 0.11$. At the second iteration, we are going to estimate the first bit of the $\\varphi$. For that we will apply only one **cantrol_H** ($exp(i 2 \\pi 0.11)$). Now we remamber value of the second bit $\\varphi_1$. It will be nice if we will subtract from the **phase** the $\\varphi_1$. We will do it with the phase gate. In qiskit this action corresponds to this gate **u1(-phase_shift, a[0])**, where **phase_shift** contains all estimated bits that we should subtract to come to the simple phase case ($0$ or $\\frac{1}{2}$ case).\n",
