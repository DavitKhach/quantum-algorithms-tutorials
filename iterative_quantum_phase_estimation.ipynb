    "The iterative quantum phase estimation (IQPE, also known as IPEA) algorithm is a quantum algorithm for estimating the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm), [2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00268976.2011.552441)]. One of the main applications of the algorithm is to estimate eigenvalues (energies) of some molecule's $H$ Hamiltonian. Because $H$ is a Hermitian operator, not unitary, (the algorithm works only with unitary operators) we can't estimate directly its eigenvalues. Instead, we create some unitary operator from $H$ and estimate not the eigenvalues of $H$, but something different (the phase). From the estimated phase one can obtain the corresponding eigenvalue of $H$. So, in the end, we are not only estimating the phase but, what is more important, the desired eigenvalue. Here are the main steps of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create unitary operator $U$ from given $H$: \n",
    "$$U = e^{iHt}.$$ \n",
    "Here $t$ is a parameter.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Apply $U$ on the eigenstate $\\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$ of $H$. For simplicity, we will assume that the eigenstate is given: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iHt} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "From the Taylor series for the exponent we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = i t H \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle - \\frac{t^2}{2} H^2 \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle + \\frac{t^4}{4} H^4 \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle - ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And by using the Schrödinger equation $H \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle = E_{k} \\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$, we will obtain: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_k$ is the eigenvalue of the corresponding $\\left| \\psi_k \\right\\rangle$ eigenstate. The goal of the algorithm is to find $E_k$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) It easy to see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$e^{iHt}\\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle = e^{iE_{k}t} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle  = e^{i 2 \\pi \\varphi_k} \\left|\\psi_k \\right\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varphi_k = E_{k}t / 2 \\pi$ is the phase that the algorithm is capable to estimate. After estimating the phase it will be easy to estimate the corresponding eigenvalue:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{k} = 2 \\pi \\varphi_k / t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how the algorithm actually works. Firstly, we should import all the packages that we will use."
