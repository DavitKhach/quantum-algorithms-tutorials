    "\n",
    "Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213?origin=ppub)] that finds the smallest eigenvalue (and corresponding eigenvector) of a given Hamiltonian. One of the main applications of the algorithm is finding ground state energy of molecules. It has a big advantage over [IPEA](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/iterative_phase_estimation.ipynb) (iterative phase estimation algorithm) and PEA (phase estimation algorithm), that also can be used for finding the ground state energy of a molecule. The main advantage is that VQE uses  much smaller circuit depths (or gates) then IPEA and PEA, what is very important for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era quantum computation. In the NISQ era (now!) we are working with qubits that are very noisy because they are not isolated from the environment well enough. Thus, there is small and finite time to work with qubits until they will be \"spoiled\", because of the environment, imperfect gates and etc. This restriction gives a big advantage to those algorithms (like VQE) that are using small depth circuits. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the VQE algorithm is as follows. We have a Hamiltonian that can be expressed by the sum of tensor products of Pauli operators (Pauli terms):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = 0.4 \\cdot IX + 0.6 \\cdot IZ + 0.8 \\cdot XY.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$ <font size=\"0.1\">$\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$</font> we want to measure the expectation value of the Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\psi \\right| H \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = 0.4 \\cdot \\left\\langle \\psi \\right| IX \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + 0.6 \\cdot \\left\\langle \\psi \\right| IZ \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle + 0.8 \\cdot \\left\\langle \\psi \\right| XY \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How one can see the $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ expectation value could be computed by adding the expectation values of its parts (Pauli terms). The algorithm does exactly that. It constructs a quantum circuit for each Pauli term and computes the expectation value of the corresponding Pauli term. Then, the algorithm sums all calculated expectation values of Pauli terms and obtains the expectation value of $H$. In this algorithm, we will do this routine of estimating the expectation value of $H$ over and over again for different trial wavefunctions (ansatz states) $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is known that the eigenvector $\\left| \\psi_g \\right\\rangle$ that minimizes the expectation value $\\left\\langle H \\right\\rangle$ corresponds to the eigenvector of $H$ that has the smallest eigenvalue [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213?origin=ppub)]. So, basically we can try all possible trial wavefunctions $\\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle$s to find the $\\left| \\psi_g \\right\\rangle$ that has the smallest expectation value. Here the question is how we create those trial states? In the algorithm, the trial states are created from a parametrized circuit. By changing the parameters one obtains different wavefunctions (ansatz states) [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5213?origin=ppub)]. If your circuit with its parameters is good enough you will have access to more or less all possible ansatz states [[2](https://www.mustythoughts.com/post/variational-quantum-eigensolver-explained)]. Otherwise, if the circuit will not have a possibility to generate our desired $\\left| \\psi_g \\right\\rangle$ it will be impossible to find the right solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters of the state preparation circuit are controlled by a classical computer. At each step, the classical computer will change the parameters by using some optimization method in order to create an ansatz state that will have a smaller expectation value then previous ansatz states had. This way the classical computer and the quantum computer are working together to archive the goal of the algorithm (to find the ground state energy). That's way, VQE is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm.\n",

The *Classical feedback decision* is some optimization method that changes the parameters of the *Quantum state preparation*. With different *Quantum modules* the algorithm calculates expectation values of each Pauli term and then it sums them by using *Classical adder* via classical computer. Then the algorithm returns to *Classical feedback decision* to choose better parameters for the *Quantum state preparation*.
